# Rise of the Warbots

This repository acts as a frame for help and support around the NFT game **Rise of the Warbots**.

## What are my options if I need help with the Website, the dApp or the game?

If you would like to report an issue, please go to [the issues page](https://github.com/rise-of-the-warbots/support/issues).
The button **new issue** will allow you to create a new support ticket, to which a team member will reply ASAP.

We encourage you to use the search function before opening an issue. Somebody before you might have had the same problem and we already solved it for them.
This will give you quicker access to a solution and keep the issue tracker clean. The team will close duplicates and refer to the original ticket, if they find a new issue to be redundant.

You may also comment on existing issues, if you find that you have the same problem as a previous reporter and wish to provide additional detail.

Finally, if you have a concrete feature request, feel free to open an issue and describe the feature you would like to see on the website, the dApp or the game.

> **ATTENTION**: the team can not help you with issues with your wallet like Metamask or TrustWallet. Please contact the support of the respective wallet, if you encounter a problem there. Alternatively, you may use our [Telegram](https://t.me/WarbotsOfficial) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/RQDyKAY) chats so other community members can help you out.

## I have a suggestion and would like to discuss it with the team and other community members. Where can I do that?

We have created a [discussions space](https://github.com/rise-of-the-warbots/support/discussions) where you can share ideas, suggestions and concepts you would like to put to discussion. This creates a space of ideas which is less short-lived than a Telegram or Discord chat.

We encourage our community to take part in the development of our game ecosystem and add their own footprint to this project.

> **ATTENTION**: marketing proposals are not the right thing to share in the discussions space. We will delete such posts when we see them.
